        \t As of today, it is believed that COVID-19 has passed
        to humans from bats. Did it happen directly, or through an intermediate
        the owner is not known for certain. \n
\t Incubation period of coronavirus: it is considered (!) That the incubation period lasts up to 14 days. \n
        \t In research 1099
        patients with a confirmed diagnosis average
        the incubation period for COVID-19 was four days
Modeling in a study of 181 patients showed that 2.5%
        of cases, symptoms develop within 2.2 days. \n and 97.5%
        cases within 11.5 days. Average incubation period
        in this study was 5.1 days.</string>

        \t To date, there is no complete understanding of
        the ways of transmission of infection.
        Initially, it was believed that the first infection occurred in the seafood market in
        Wuhan province. \n
        \t But, over time, the transmission path from person to person was confirmed.
The main route of transmission of the coronavirus COVID-19 is contact. Sick or carrier sneezing
        and / or coughing, spreads mucus particles that contain the virus. Radius
        spread from a person within 2 meters. In this radius can happen
        direct infection. Outside this radius, infection occurs
        on contact with a contaminated surface. Healthy man touching
        the infected surface becomes contaminated with a virus, further, by touching
        to the face with his hands, he transfers the virus to the mucous membranes and
        infection occurs.

    <string name="Simpom2">
    \t Fever in 99 percent of cases. \n
   \t Weakness, fatigue in 70 percent of cases. \n
    \t Dry cough in 59 percent of cases. \n
   \t Loss of appetite in 40 percent of cases. \n
   \t Muscle pain in 35 percent of cases. \n
   \t Shortness of breath in 31 percent of cases. \n
  \t  Coughing up phlegm in 27 percent of cases. \n
   \t Other less common symptoms include headache,
    sore throat, and rhinorrhea (nasal discharge). \n
   \t In addition to respiratory symptoms, there are also
    gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and diarrhea. \n

    \t As you can see, the most common symptom of coronavirus
    infection is fever. But it should be noted that the temperature
    level is also not indicative. So, out of 1,099 patients admitted to a hospital in Wuhan with
    COVID-19, temperatures above 37.5 degrees were observed in only 44% of patients.</string>
